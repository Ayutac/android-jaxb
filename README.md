##Library to convert XML Schema to SimpleXML annotated classes for Android

Library works to convert simple XSD files without inheritance and multiple namespaces to SimpleXML annotated Java classes. This solves my current requirement.

Drop a note to yeshodhan.kulkarni@gmail.com or raise an issue if anyone needs support for more complex schemas.
